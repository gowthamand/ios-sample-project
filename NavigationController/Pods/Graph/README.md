## Creating an Entity for an ImageCard

An **Entity** is a model (data) object that represents a **person**, **place**, or **thing**. It may store property values, be a member of groups, and can be tagged.

In the following example, we create an ImageCard view using Material and populate it's properties with an Entity that stores the data for that view.

![Material ImageCard](http://www.cosmicmind.com/gifs/white/image-card.gif)

#### Creating data

```swift
let graph = Graph()

let entity = Entity(type: "ImageCard")
entity["title"] = "Graph"
entity["detail"] = "Build Data-Driven Software"
entity["content"] = "Graph is a semantic database that is used to create data-driven applications."
entity["author"] = "CosmicMind"
entity["image"] = UIImage.load(contentsOfFile: "frontier", ofType: "jpg")

graph.sync()
```

#### Setting the view's properties

```swift
imageCard.toolbar?.title = entity["title"] as? String
imageCard.toolbar?.detail = entity["detail"] as? String
imageCard.imageView?.image = entity["image"] as? UIImage

let contentLabel = UILabel()
contentLabel.text = entity["content"] as? String
imageCard.contentView = contentLabel

let authorLabel = UILabel()
authorLabel.text = entity["author"] as? String
imageCard.bottomBar?.centerViews = [authorLabel]
```

## Searching a list of users in realtime

Using the **Search** API is incredibly flexible. In the following example, Search is used to create a live search on user names with a dynamic UI provided by [Material's SearchBar](http://cosmicmind.com/material/searchbar).

![Material SearchBar](http://www.cosmicmind.com/gifs/shared/search-bar-controller.gif)

#### Preparing the search criteria

```swift
let graph = Graph()

let search = Search<Entity>(graph: graph).for(types: "User").where(properties: "name")
```

#### Asynchronously searching graph

```swift        
search.async { [weak self, pattern = pattern] (users) in

	guard let regex = try? NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern, options: []) else {
	    return
    }

	var data = [Entity]()

	for user in users {
		if let name = user["name"] as? String {
			let matches = regex.matches(in: name, range: NSRange(location: 0, length: name.utf16.count))

			if 0 < matches.count {
				data.append(user)
			}
		}
	}

	self?.tableView.data = data
}
```
